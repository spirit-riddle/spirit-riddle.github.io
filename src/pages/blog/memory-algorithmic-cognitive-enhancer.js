          Have you ever noticed how easily you remember song lyrics compared to
          other types of information? That’s because rhythm, melody, and pitch
          create a unique brain connection. This cognitive enhancer builds on
          that idea, helping you "paint the notes" as you roll your voice
          through phrases you want to remember. It’s like creating a colorful
          soundscape for your memory.

          The Cognitive Enhancer

            <strong>What It Is:</strong> A simple process that mimics how music influences memory. Instead of aiming for a tune, you "paint the notes" by rolling your voice up and down—like a brush stroke on a musical canvas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How It Works:</strong> Recite your word or phrase while gently moving your voice through a range of pitches. Imagine hitting all the notes of every song you remember, but don’t worry about perfection. If you're new to this, staying within one octave or taking little rests is perfectly fine. For those feeling bold, you can explore higher ranges.

          Songs are memorable because they engage multiple areas of the brain—language, rhythm, melody, and emotion. By rolling your voice through notes, this enhancer replicates that effect, turning your words into a flowing melody that sticks with you.

          <li>
            <strong>Prepare:</strong> Choose a phrase, list, or set of ideas you want to memorize.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Engage:</strong> Recite the information while rolling your voice up and down. Think of it as brushing through a rainbow of notes, one by one.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> Keep going until it starts to feel natural. Stay playful and experiment with your range—whether it’s just a simple rise and fall or a more elaborate sweep.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anchor:</strong> After a few tries, pause and test yourself by recalling the information without singing it. You’ll notice it comes to you more easily.
